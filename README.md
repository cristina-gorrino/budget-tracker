## Description

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

This application allows the user to keep track of expenses and earnings whether they are currently online or not. The app has a simple form to enter spending or income transactions. These are added or subtracted from the total and reflected on the graph for the user to see. If the user is offline, the transactions are stored on the IndexedDB so that they can be added to the regular database once the internet connection is established again.

Deployed Link: https://obscure-thicket-21686.herokuapp.com/

## Installation
    
You can use the deployed app (see the link above), or you can clone the repo, install node and all dependencies, and run mongo DB to use it locally.

## Usage
    
On the deployed version you can go to the app, and use the form to enter a transaction and a dollar amount. For example, you might spend $10 on lunch. Then click the button to subtract the amount from the budget. This will decrease your total by $10 and the transaction will be reflected on the graphs. You can also use your browser dev tools to test the functionality while offline.
